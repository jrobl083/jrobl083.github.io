          I've worked in a variety of jobs and positions throughout my career, all of which have shaped my professional identity and helped me grow. My path started in the demanding field of biohazard cleanup, where I honed my attention to detail and strong work ethic. As I made the shift to the hectic work environments of McDonald's and Subway, I improved my customer service abilities and discovered the value of productivity and collaboration. I now combine my varied experiences as a valued member of the culinary team at Lothian Dining Hall to provide outstanding dining experiences while encouraging a feeling of community. My first job after entering the workforce was in biohazard cleanup, which was a tough but forming experience that gave me a strong sense of accountability and diligence. I gained knowledge about how crucial it is to follow safety procedures and laws while paying close attention to details in this role. I approached every task with unwavering professionalism and dedication, whether it involved safely disposing of hazardous materials or sanitizing contaminated surfaces. I learned the value of resilience from this experience, and it also helped me get ready for the challenges my career would present. After leaving biohazard cleanup, I entered the fast-paced field of fast-food service, working my way up to positions at Subway and McDonald's. I was a natural in the fast-paced kitchen environment at McDonald's, where I excelled at everything from food prep to customer service. I gained experience working with a diverse team and realized how crucial it is to collaborate well and communicate well in order to maintain efficiency during peak times. My ability to multitask was enhanced, and I gained a deeper understanding of the nuances of customer satisfaction as a result of this experience. During my time at Subway, I developed my ability to tailor sandwiches to each customer's specific preferences, which further enhanced my customer service skills. Providing outstanding experiences to each and every customer was my top priority, whether it was suggesting toppings or making sure service arrived on time. I now have a deep appreciation for the art of hospitality thanks to this role, which also reaffirmed how crucial empathy and attentiveness are to creating enduring relationships with customers. I am honored to work as an essential part of the culinary team at Lothian Dining Hall today, where I use my variety of experiences to make meals that both faculty and students will remember. Situated amidst the lively campus community, the dining hall functions as a center of culinary brilliance, providing a diverse range of mouthwatering and wholesome choices to cater to all tastes. I work in this fast-paced setting with creative chefs and colleagues to create menus that are not only creative but also meet the highest standards for food quality and presentation. In addition to my culinary responsibilities, working at Lothian Dining Hall gives me the opportunity to build relationships and a feeling of community among the student body. Whether it's interacting with customers during meal service or meeting special dietary requirements, my goal is to establish a warm and inclusive atmosphere for everyone. All these jobs have made me who I am today, a hard worker that loves to learn and even teach.
